        artificial intelligence
        In the mid-1980s, researchers developed computers capable of making some decisions based on solutions to pre-programmed problems. However, developers failed to exploit this invention in practical applications, and with the continued technological progress, computers were able to learn and solve problems autonomously. 1997 man was defeated for the first time in chess by computer. The continuous inventions and improvements prompted artificial intelligence to become today an urgent need and an effective indispensable means.</big></p>
